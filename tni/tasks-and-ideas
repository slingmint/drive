* installing optional components:
    * /root/optional
            ./install-x
            ./install-y
            ./install-optional.sh
                run each sh file in /root/optional/install then remove the files
    * just need to copy the files you wan to install to the /root/optional/install directory

    * or something easy like that to run multiple installers with one command rather than having to wait and run each individually

* Also, need to modify git clone to move towards devops
